Just unzip our files into yours.

It is supposed to contain :
 - The dangerMap python file to compute the danger map
 - The miniMax python file used to solve miniMax when required
 - The attackSafeAgent python file that defines the behavior of our attacker
 - The defenseAgent python file that defines the behavior of our defender
 - The group4AI python file that links our behaviors' scripts and initialize the teams

To use it, just type  "python capture.py -b "yourTeam" -r group4AI" into your console after extracting the five python scrips

If you have any questions, feel free to ask in the discord!
